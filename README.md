### Main Architectural Features + Assets
The design can be broken down to three levels: 
- The top
  - Embellished design on the tip of the roof, rounded top with small gated courtyard. with horizontally elongated windows and golden plated designs underneath 
- The middle
   - Middle building structures have a different window style (red panel then window panel)

- The bottom
   - Bottom buildings are mostly red wall with small windows in the top

- Red rectangular gates
- Frilly rooftop that fans out
- Cube-like shape in sub-buildings
- large rectangular window panes divided up into squares
- white paper screen above glass windows
- Golden ribs under roof for support
- Red pillars
- Triangular caved-in rooftops on parts of buildings jutting out

- For this assignment, we will be ignoring the trees and rocks for now.
